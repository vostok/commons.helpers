# Vostok.Commons.Helpers

[![Build & Test & Publish](https://github.com/vostok/commons.helpers/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vostok/commons.helpers/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This library contains various helpers used across multiple Vostok libraries that don't fit to any other `vostok.commons.*` module. 

It is a special case of a [source library](https://github.com/vostok/devtools/blob/master/library-dev-conventions/src-libs-conventions.md). It is not published as a NuGet package, because its code is not intended to be used outside of Vostok.
