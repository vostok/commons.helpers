# Vostok.Commons.Helpers

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/vostok/commons.helpers?svg=true&branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vostok/commons.helpers/branch/master)

This library contains various helpers used across multiple Vostok libraries that don't fit to any other `vostok.commons.*` module. 

It is a special case of a [source library](https://github.com/vostok/devtools/blob/master/library-dev-conventions/src-libs-conventions.md). It is not published as a NuGet package, because its code is not intended to be used outside of Vostok.
